**Requirement analysis:**

**Problem Statement –**

The salary calculator is a tool that calculates your take-home salary. It is the total salary an employee gets after all the necessary deductions. The salary calculator consists of a formula box, where you enter the Cost To Company (CTC) and the bonus included in the CTC.

The salary calculator will show you the deductions such as the  employee provident fund, professional tax, employee insurance, and the take-home salary.

It will also show you the amount of tax you need to pay annually.

**High Level Requirement –**

**Business Strategy –**

The project focusses on the calculation of the salary and the income tax they have to pay according to their annual income.

**User Strategy –** 

The user will be able to find their in hand salary of a month as well as the tax they have to pay annually.

Input- 

- The user has to input his/her annual salary.
- Employee also needs to enter his name.
- The user has to enter the organization’s name and the email id.
- The user has to enter the bonus amount.
- The user also need to enter insurance amount.

**System Strategy-**

To calculate the in hand salary the employee must enter the cost to company and the bonus if any as a fixed amount or a percentage of the CTC. For example – your CTC is 6 Lakhs , the employer gives you a bonus of 50,000 Rupees for the year. Your total gross salary will be 6,00,000- 50,000 = 550000(The bonus must be deducted from CTC). The calculator then deducts the professional tax of RS 2400 annually. The calculator then subtracts the contribution of the employee towards the employee provident fund(EPF).

Total deductions = Professional tax + EPF(Employee contribution)+Bonus+ tax+(insurance)

If user has opted for the insurance in the company , he/she needs to enter the insurance amount(annually) . It will be deducted from the in hand salary.

Output-

- The user will get the amount of tax employee has to pay annually.
- The program will display the in hand (monthly) salary.
